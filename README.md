# Markdown README Generator

  ## Description

  This is a command-line application built using  Node.JS that dynamically generates a professional-quality README file for any project. Running the application will generate a series of prompts, that will take your answers and quickly generate a REAME that includes standard sections like title, description, installation, instructions, usage information, and license details.

  - Motivation: To make the process of creating a high-quality README very streamlined and efficient for every project.
  - Reason: To save time for myself, and other developers while containing consistency and quality in project documentation
  - Problem Solved: It eliminates the need to manually write a README file from scratch for every project, and ensures all critical sections are included.
  - What I Learned: This Project enhanced my understanding of Node.JS, file handling with the fs module, using inquirer.js for interactive CLI applications, and modular JavaScript with ES6 imports and exports.
